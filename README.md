# Sudoku-Solver

A project that solves a simple Sudoku

## Description

This project is able to read a .txt file containing a simple Sudoku with a specific format and solve it. For the program to successfully recognize the text as a Sudoku, the following are required:  
1. Every unknown square is encoded as the digit 0
2. Every known square is encoded as the digit that appears on the square
3. The order of the digits that appear in the text file is the same as the order of the digits that appear on the Sudoku
3. Each pair of adjacent squares on the Sudoku are separated by a whitespace when encoded into the text file
4. Every new row in the Sudoku is encoded as a new row in the text file

The following is an example of a recognizable Sudoku:  
0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 1  
3 2 0 0 0 0 8 0 0  
7 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
